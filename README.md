## Deployment

The fastest way to deploy RVM is by using our first-party [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/code4romania/rvm).

### Prerequisites

#### Generate an application key

To generate an application key, you can run the following command in your terminal.

```sh
docker run --rm -it code4romania/rvm php artisan key:generate --show
```

The generated application key will look like this:

```

```

### Running the image

Download the [example `docker-compose.yml`](docs/examples/docker-compose.yml) and configure the environment variables. Here's where you use the `APP_KEY` generated earlier. After you're done, save the file and run it with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
